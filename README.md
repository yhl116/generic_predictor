# Generic Predictor
Generic predictor library written on top of [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Inputs in data either from a pandas DataFrame or from .csv and have the library compare models, choose best models and make the best prediction. Separated into the following prediction problems:
1. data_preprocessing.py
2. generic_binary_classifier.py
3. generic_regressor.py

## Usage
Import high level libraries and feed in data. The script uses grid search to look for best models.

## Work in Progress
1. Currently working on generic_binary classifier.

## Furthur Work
1. data_preprocessing
2. generic_regressor
